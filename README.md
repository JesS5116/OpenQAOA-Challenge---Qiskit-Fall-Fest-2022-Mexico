# Welcome to Entropica Labs Challenge!

Every Algorithm has a Beginning!

The success of a QAOA depends, among many factors, on the choice of initial parameters. Choose poorly, and training will be lengthy and complex. Choose wisely, and you may stand a chance to see the QAOA succeed!

## Getting started

First, you will need to install OpenQAOA. The simplest way to do that is

1. In a new environment, install OpenQAOA. It is simple; you just need to run `pip install openqaoa` :)

(if you face issues with the instal, give us a shout! Most likely, you can fix most errors by simply creating a new environment: follow [this](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands) tutorial from Conda and then install openqaoa via `pip` )

2. Now that you are set, you can start exploring OpenQAOA. To get started, you can:
    2.1 Check out OpenQAOA's official documentation: - [Run your first OpenQAOA workflow](https://el-openqaoa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/1_workflows_example.html)
    2.2 Check out the intro notebooks that have been created especially for this challenge
    2.3 Go to the challenge notebook!
